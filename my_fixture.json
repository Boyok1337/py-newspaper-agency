To advance to the next round, the team must place among the tournament's top ten based on the match results.\r\n\r\nIf NAVI players accomplish this task, they will move on to the lower bracket second round, which takes place the night after the first (starts on Sunday at 04:00 CET). If it doesn't go their way, the team will leave the tournament.\r\n\r\nSupport our guys during the livestream!",

      "content": "This evening, Valve has released a major update to CS2, with further improvements and optimizations to the game. The changes have also affected competitive Counter-Strike, as Dust 2 has returned to the map pool, replacing Overpass.\r\n\r\nFor Born to Win, these changes are positive. In the last three months, our team has only played twice on Overpass, and we scored a win against BetBoom at the PGL Major Copenhagen 2024 Europe RMR A (13 : 4).\r\n\r\nIn 2022, Dust 2 was one of the best NAVI maps: In eighteen matches, our team was defeated only three times and finished the year with 83.3% of victories on this map.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the ESL Pro League S19 will be played on the previous update, so we can expect a few farewell Overpass games from NAVI!",
